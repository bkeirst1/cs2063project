Description: Kimura is a UFC companion app that allows the user to compare fighters, view upcoming events, view the UFC roster, and even create your own dream fight card. The app has four tabs, each of which contains one of these four main functionalities. The compare tab prompts the user to select two fighters, and then displays various statistics for those fighters side by side. The upcoming events tab displays a list of upcoming events and their corresponding fights. The roster tab displays a list of all registered fighters in the UFC. The app also allows the user to create their own fight card/event by allowing the user to create their own custom matchups. 

Data: The Kimura companion app gets its data directly from ufcstats.com through custom web scraping software. Every time the app is launched the data is scraped and therefore is always most up to date.
